# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a medical dataset and applies supervised learning techniques to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various clinical attributes.

## Dataset
- The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).
- Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Visualizations for correlation and feature importance
- Model comparison for selecting the best performing algorithm

## Results
- Achieved competitive accuracy with Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- Helpful tool for initial diagnosis support in medical settings
